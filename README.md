# Circles-in-Circles-Fractal
This project was a interesting geometrical challenge I created to demonstrate and use my knowledge of recursion. 

The program draws circles within a master circle (similar to a sierpinski triangle). By clicking the up/down keys, you are able to change how many circles a contained within the previous circle. Furthermore, by pressing the right/left keys, you are able to change the "depth" or amount of overlying circles. You are also able to change the colour of the circles through a keypad press.

# Coding Challenges
The largest challenge byfar was understanding and then coding the math. Particularly, it was difficult to understand how to figure out where the center of each circle should be, especially when the user changes the number. I always was aware that the use of trigonometry was needed, however it took a while to get the math correct and use the recursion successfully. 

Another challenge, and definitely a limitation, was the fact that since I used recursion to draw the circle, if the user requests a large depth number or lots of circles, the program lags a lot. This is something I would be interested in adressing in the future using a faster algorithm.
